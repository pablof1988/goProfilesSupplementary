# goSorensenSupplementary
Supplementary material for Equivalence test based on the Sorensen - Dice index for comparison of feature lists.

allOncoGOprofilesTopDown.R performs a top-down equivalence analysis on the allOncoGeneLists.rda gene lists.

allOncoGOprofilesEquivalencies.R takes the output of this script to summarize the found equivalencies.

Similarly, pbtGOprofilesTopDown.R performs a top-down analysis on the pbtGeneLists2.rda gene lists and pbtGOprofilesEquivalencies.R summarizes the found equivalencies.
